# WIPP - Web Image Processing Pipelines

![](logo-wipp.png)

## What is WIPP?

Web Image Processing Pipelines (WIPP) is an open-source web-based algorithmic plugin platform for trusted image-based measurements from terabyte-sized images developped at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) - National Center for Advancing Translational Science (NCATS).

The goal of this project is to lower the bar for users and algorithm developers to execute and share image analyses over terabyte-sized image collections in high-throughput and high content microscopy imaging applications. 
- Upload collections of microscopy images,
- Register algorithmic plugins,
- Configure image processing workflows,
- Stitch grids of small fields of view,
- Visualize and analyze large fields of view interactively using the pyramid view,
- Extract image features and customize scatterplots,
- Train and use Tensorflow models for image segmentation,
- Prototype algorithms with polyglot Jupyter notebooks.

WIPP is designed as an expandable platform leveraging containerization and orchestration technologies such as Docker and Kubernetes and is meant to be deployed on a Kubernetes cluster (see [Installation instructions](#installation)).

The core of the WIPP framework consists of:
- the [WIPP REST API](https://github.com/usnistgov/WIPP-backend), based on the Java Spring framework,
- the [WIPP web UI](https://github.com/usnistgov/WIPP-frontend), an Angular 7 application,
- a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database,
- [Keycloak], an open source identity and access management server,
- [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/), a container native workflow engine for Kubernetes,
- WIPP Plugins, algorithmic plugins packaged as Docker images.

Additional tools can be added to the WIPP core for a more complete system:
- [JupyterHub](https://github.com/PolusAI/jupyterlab-extensions/tree/master/jupyterlab_wipp), to develop polyglot Jupyter notebooks that can be used in WIPP workflows,
- [Plots](https://github.com/PolusAI/polus-plots-ui), for scalable and interactive scatterplots visualization,
- [Tensorboard](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard), for Tensorflow jobs monitoring,
- [Elastic Stack](https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elk-stack) for application, logs and system monitoring.

## Installation
For a quick start, we provide instructions for the deployment of a complete installation of WIPP on a single-node Kubernetes cluster.  

[Installing WIPP on a single-node cluster](deployment/wipp-complete-single-node/README.md)

Instructions are provided for popular operating systems using simple solutions for setting up a single-node Kubernetes cluster: 
- macOS (with Docker Desktop)
- macOS (with Multipass+microk8s)
- Linux (Multipass+microk8s)
- Windows 10 (Multipass+microk8s)

The following components are included in the single-node deployment:
- WIPP REST API and UI,
- MongoDB,
- Keycloak,
- Argo Workflows,
- JupyterLab,
- Plots,
- Tensorboard.

### GPU support - optional
We provide WIPP plugins for CNN-based segmentation using Tensorflow. These plugins require access to a GPU in the Kubernetes cluster.  
The requirements for running the using the [WIPP UNet CNN Semantic-Segmentation Training plugin](https://github.com/usnistgov/WIPP-unet-train-plugin) and [WIPP UNet CNN Semantic-Segmentation Inference plugin](https://github.com/usnistgov/WIPP-unet-inference-plugin) are:
- Cuda 10.1 installed,
- nvidia-docker-runtime and set as default docker runtime
- GPU support enabled in the cluster (for example, by installing the [NVIDIA Device Plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) or enabling the `gpu` addon in microk8s)

Alternatively, some GPU cards may be compatible with the preview release of the [NVIDIA GPU Operator for Kubernetes](https://github.com/NVIDIA/gpu-operator), which aims to simplify NVIDIA GPU resources in Kubernetes clusters.


### Important security information
The WIPP framework deployment instructions are provided for deploying a testing instance of the system. Additional configurations may be required for a secure and scalable deployment.
*We recommend deployments on private networks behind a firewall.*

## User Guide

User guide detailing how to perform routine operations in WIPP, such as uploading images, registering plugins and configuring workflows is available in the [user guide folder](user-guide).

## Test datasets

To test a fresh installation of WIPP, we provide three sample datasets with instructions on how to run test workflows using these datasets in the [data folder](data).

## WIPP plugins

Links to manifest files to install the currently available WIPP plugins can be found in the [plugins folder](plugins).  

Part of the WIPP ecosystem, the WIPP Registry allows the registration and search of available plugins:
- Demo instance https://wipp-plugins.nist.gov/
- Deployment instructions available [here](https://github.com/usnistgov/WIPP-Registry)

Existing WIPP plugins can be used as learn-by-example templates for creating new plugins. A basic template for Python-based plugins is provided here: [Python sample plugin](https://github.com/usnistgov/WIPP-Plugins-base-templates/tree/master/sample-plugins/python-threshold).

The WIPP plugin manifest schema is available [at this link](https://github.com/usnistgov/WIPP-Plugins-base-templates/blob/master/plugin-manifest/schema/wipp-plugin-manifest-schema.json).


## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the installation or usage of WIPP, you can get help using one of the following options:
- open an issue on the repository,
- send an email to the [WIPP team](mailto:wipp-team@nist.gov).
